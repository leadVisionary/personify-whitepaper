Life is a Self-Adaptive System

Dictionary.com defines Life as “the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.” [1]
Hence, any biological organism may be considered as a self-adaptive system. Software that simulates biological entities such as mentors and students[2] may be a good source to show properties of self-adaptation.
