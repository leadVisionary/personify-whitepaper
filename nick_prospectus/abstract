Abstract

Self-adaptive systems pose a variety of technical and managerial challenges for software engineering. They typically involve complex interactions between systems or systems of systems which must dynamically react and satisfice goals in a variety of contexts. It is not well understood how to engineer such systems consistently. Some approaches seek to view these systems through traditional software engineering lenses, such as developing formal requirements languages for self-adaptive systems. In this work, we explore whether cutting edge concepts in Agile methodologies and Lean software development can be applied to build such types of systems.
