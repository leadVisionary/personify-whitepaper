Who came up with the idea of Systems?

Thermodynamics and physics extended the mathematical concept of a system in the 1800s, but the usage was still nebulous and non-standardized. The common understanding of a system arose Ludwig von Bertalanffy in 1945. Many of its core concepts -- such as models, principles, laws, and the forces between them-- were formalized by his work.
