What does Adaptability depend on? A case study: Humans

Suppose we argue that humans are not very adaptable. They are prone to becoming stuck in certain mindsets and methodologies that software may not be, on the surface. One could say that we build software applications to enable human adaptability, for tasks such as scheduling, communication, etc. Yet software itself can be argued to be not very adaptable when a system is monolithic and difficult to change. Humans are also very adaptable at certain stages in life, for example childhood. They say a child is a “blank slate”, and “you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” Could these ideas give us some insight into adaptability?
