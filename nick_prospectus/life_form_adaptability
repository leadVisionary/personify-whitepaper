Are life forms really the best example of adaptability?

But are biological organisms really the best examples of adaptability? One can argue, for example, that humans are not very adaptable. Perhaps the existence of conditions such as bigotry and close-mindedness signal that life isn’t as adaptable as one would think. 
Unless we consider that adaptability may not be a binary/Boolean condition. Perhaps it exists in a spectrum. Perhaps adaptability happens in various degrees. Perhaps a subject’s adaptability is a function of certain fundamental properties.
