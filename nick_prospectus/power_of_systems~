The Power of Systems

Getting a good feeling for the definition of a system as a set of relationships--which may themselves be sets of relationships-- gives us a powerful abstraction for describing our natural world. 

The sets of relationships and subsequent interactions between organisms living in an ecosystem may be described as a biological system. 

The sets of relationships and subsequent interactions between particles in space may be described as a  thermodynamic system. 

The sets of relationships and subsequent interactions between people in a geological region may be called a political or sociological system. 

The sets of relationships and subsequent interactions between suppliers and demanders across may be called an economic system. 

The sets of relationships and subsequent interactions between concepts and their resultant points of view may be called an epistemological system. 

Clearly, the beauty of the system construct is in its abstraction and generality. Understanding of the relationships between things allows analysis and comprehension of a space.
