Everything is a System?

“System” is a label humans apply to an abstract idea. It is primarily a conceptual construct. People commonly first encounter the word “system” in a formal sense in mathematics. Introductory algebra teaches us about systems of equations.

[Ref1]
 
Systems are defined as a set of relationships between equations. Equations are relationships between dependent and independent variables. Systems then are a set of relationships between directed relationships, input and output. This aligns well with it Latin meaning, roughly analogous to “whole comprised of several parts.”
