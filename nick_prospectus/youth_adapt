Children adapt because they are young

Children are very adaptive because they do not have a wide variety of experiences. Experiences result in an accumulation of information and construction of representations of the world in one’s head. Experiences test, refine, and add to our mental models.

Age generally causes experiences and representations accumulate. Though this is not necessarily true. A person could live a “simple life” of routine, very rarely engaging in new experiences and hence having very little new information to integrate into their mental models.   

But it seems clear that if a person is young, they begin with a small mental model. If they have eclectic experiences, that model will shift. When the model is small, the rate of adaptation is much faster.
