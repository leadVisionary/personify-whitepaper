Are there examples of self-adaptive systems in non-software contexts?

The software community thrives when it derives inspiration from the natural world to shape the way it thinks about itself. From humble beginnings in mathematical terms such as functions and domains, to recent emergence of base concepts such as behaviors and patterns, software evolves as it incorporates more elements of the natural world into its parlance. Similarly, as we seek to imbue self-adaptation into software systems, it makes sense to ask: “what exists in the natural world that is self-adaptive?”
