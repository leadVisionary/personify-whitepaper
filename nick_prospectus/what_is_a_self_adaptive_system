What is a Self Adaptive System?

The research community lacks a standard definition of a self-adaptive system. Nevertheless, general agreement states that self-adaptive systems are aware of their internal state, their surrounding environment, and can adjust their behavior according to change in context. [1]  This definition seems to implicitly depend on the notion of a software agent, which has a non-standard but accepted definition of an encapsulated computer system that is situated in some environment and is capable of flexible, autonomous action in order to meet its design objectives.
