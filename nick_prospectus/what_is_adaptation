What is Adaptation?

Dictionary.com defines adaptation as “the state of adapting; adjustment.”[Ref1] Adapt is defined as “to make suitable to requirements or conditions” when it is used with an object, “to adjust oneself to different conditions, environment, etc” without [Ref2]. Hence, one could argue that anything that is capable of adjusting itself to changing conditions or circumstances is “adaptive.” Adaptation, in fact, is one of the base requirements for defining life, in the biological sense.

Of course, “adapt” is a verb, not a noun like “system.” Therefore, the notion of adaptation cannot exist without a subject, a thing that adapts. Traditional English, built a “subject-verb-object” sentence structure, suggests that something must also exist to be adapted from/to, the object. We can call this the environment. More generally, the context. 

Systems adapt to change in context.
