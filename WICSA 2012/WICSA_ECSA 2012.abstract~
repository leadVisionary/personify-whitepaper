Society.io: Towards a lean software architectural pattern oriented reference model for self-adaptive system by leveraging BDD, DDD, CI, DSLs, and functional programming

Self-adaptive systems are an area of active research within software engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, and many other fields. The most prevalent research approaches have taken to solving the problem of autonomous adaptation of software using theory-heavy approaches such as extensions to Z, development of adaptation modeling tools for UML, and other traditional techniques. The literature has been mainly silent on the application of the best practices of modern software engineering, including Agile methodology tools, advanced principles of design and architecture, and the shift towards dynamic programming paradigms. We argue that these tools are a natural fit for the development of such systems. Effective combination and use describes software as a society of interacting agents that can display goal-oriented, autonomous behavior. In this exploration, we present rzr, a framework leveraging Convention over Configuration and best practice approaches to achieve cognitive scaffolding of self-adaptive systems. We describe current.ly, a cutting edge hypermedia personalization platform, and build a Scout, a finely grained composable abstraction generalizable archetype of agent that will play a prominent role in the development of future systems.
